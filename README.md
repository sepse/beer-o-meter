# Beer-O-Meter üç∫

## Overview
This project uses open source technology to measure and display the flow of beer through the tubes of a draft machine. By integrating an Arduino Mega, a flow sensor (XXX), nine Neomatrix 8x8 panels, an RFID reader, and an electronic valve, the system provides real-time insights into the amount of beer dispensed. This solution addresses the common challenge of tracking beer usage, offering a clear and accurate measurement that was previously unavailable.

## Features
- **Real-Time Flow Measurement**: Continuously monitors beer flow using a dedicated sensor.
- **Dynamic Visual Display**: Utilizes nine Neomatrix 8x8 LED panels to present live flow data in an engaging format.
- **User Identification**: Incorporates an RFID reader for user-specific tracking or session management.
- **Automated Control**: Employs an electronic valve to regulate beer flow based on measured data.
- **Open Source & Customizable**: All hardware designs and software code are available for community enhancement and adaptation.

## Components Used
- **Arduino Mega**: Acts as the central microcontroller to coordinate sensor readings, display updates, and control the valve.
- **Flow Sensor XXX**: Accurately measures the flow rate of beer through the draft machine‚Äôs tubes.
- **Neomatrix 8x8 Panels (9 pieces)**: LED matrices that visually represent the flow of beer, making the data easy to understand at a glance.
- **RFID Reader**: Facilitates user identification or session-specific data logging.
- **Electronic Valve**: Controls the beer flow, enabling automated management and safety measures.

## System Architecture
The system operates by collecting data from the flow sensor, which is then processed by the Arduino Mega. The processed data is displayed on the LED matrix panels, providing an intuitive visualization of the beer dispensed. Additionally, the RFID reader enables tracking of individual sessions or users, and the electronic valve is used to modulate the beer flow as needed.

## Arduino Code
The heart of this project is the Arduino code, which manages:
- **Sensor Initialization**: Sets up the flow sensor, RFID reader, LED panels, and electronic valve.
- **Data Acquisition**: Reads and processes the flow sensor‚Äôs output in real time.
- **Data Display**: Drives the Neomatrix panels to visualize the amount of beer dispensed.
- **User Interaction**: Integrates RFID-based user identification for tailored data logging.
- **Flow Control**: Activates the electronic valve based on pre-defined thresholds to ensure controlled dispensing.
